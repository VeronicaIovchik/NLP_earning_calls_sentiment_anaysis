Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Operator Instructions I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\\nMatt Ginter Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Before we begin just a quick reminder. On the morning of Tuesday December 7 well host our annual outlook meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City. Those of you that are on our email distribution list shouldve received an invitation earlier this week. Please RSVP as soon as you can and for those of you who are not on our list who would wish to go just drop a note or call and well take care of you. Take a moment if you would to read the forwardlooking statement on Slide 2. During todays conference call well make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ from our predictions. So lets begin todays review. Ill turn the program over to George Buckley. Please turn to Slide 3.\\nGeorge Buckley Thank you very much Matt. And good morning everybody and thank you very much for joining us on our third quarter call. It was another very strong quarter for 3M as we continue to drive our growth plan and overall Q3 sales and earnings were in line with our expectations. And if you can imagine Im especially pleased with the 11 increase in organic volume because of the backdrop of continued economic uncertainty and tougher comps. Organic volumes are now up 16 through September and we continue to set sales and profit records. Q3 sales brought in a new record for 3M with the strongest growth coming in EC  Electro and Communications business where sales were up 25 Display and Graphic where sales were up 19 and Industrial and Transportation where they were up 14 and Consumer  Office which was up an impressive 11. And they for example exceeded 1 billion in sales for the first time ever in a quarter. Health Care and Safety and Security is still robust but both had some peculiarities to deal with in the quarter which Ill explain in a minute. We continue to grow across all geographies once again reinforcing our international growth strategy. Sales in emerging markets as a whole were up 25 in the quarter and now exceeds 34 of total company sales. Asia Pacific grew 28 Latin America grew 14 and Canada 13. Korea was up 48 India 39 Russia 32 and the China region was up 31 with Brazil up 25 as well. Operating margins remain strong at 23 with all businesses staying at operating margins of 20 or higher. EPS was 1.53 up 13 another alltime Q3 record for 3M. Free cash flow was 1.1 billion with nearly 100 conversion rate. We also continued our accelerated investments in the future. We consider that this is extraordinary important in solving the puzzle of higher growth rates longer term. So for example we increased RD investment by 6 year on year and we supported our brands with increased advertising and merchandising expense of more than 30. The business venture investments which are those investments outside RD continue to track at about 100 million additional annual spend yearoveryear. We put more capital work by closing the acquisitions of Arizant and Attenti Holdings and we acquired a majority stake in Cogent Inc. and in early October we also announced the acquisition of Alpha Beta which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Ill address those acquisitions in more detail in a few moments. Overall the strength of 3Ms portfolio was again evident in the third quarter. Industrial and Transportation which is the giant of 3Ms businesses where sales rose a huge 14 with broadbased doubledigit local currency growth in every single unit led by Renewables Energy division which was up 83 in sales and limited solely by manufacturing capacity which were adding as fast as we can. The growth is everywhere in industrial. As examples Energy and Advanced Materials rose to 25 Abrasives was up 18 Automotive OEM was up 17 and Industrial Adhesives and Tapes which is our largest business was up 13. As evidenced in our success in Automotive Q3 will ride Automotive growth of up 10 while 3Ms organic volumes are up 18. Yeartodate worldwide automotive builds are up 29 while 3Ms organic volumes are up 40. Operating income for the sector rose by 14 to 446 million with operating margins at 20.2. A remarkable reinvention of this heartland of 3Ms business by AC Shen ph and his team is nothing short of stunning. Health Care. Sales rose there by 1.5 in local currency which is much slower than weve seen in recent quarters. The most evident impact in the quarter was the reduced H1N1 related demand which lowered yearonyear growth rates by full two percentage points. You recall that H1N1 demand was the highest in the third quarter of last year. Lowcore demand seems to be related to the uncertainty surrounding of Obama care. Youve seen that pattern reflected in pretty much every company reporting so far in the Health Care space. Hospital admissions and treatments are down at many U.S. hospitals so distributors are wary and evidently running down inventories. As an illustration I recently read that 50 of Cincinnati hospitals have reported lower admissions. Higher unemployment and weaker financial seem to be closing people to pull off elective procedures and even normal health care as well. We have no reason to believe that this is anything other than temporary effect and that it will pass. But clearly there is caution everywhere as we weve seen similar slowing in Western Europe. Thats a news with our Skin and Wound Care business was up 7 Food Safety absent of divestiture we did last year was up 12 and Dental was up 4. Operating income in Health Care was 326 million with margins just short of 30. At our December outlook meeting well give you some additional views on how Health Care reform might affect our business. But the short form is that the impact is likely to be felt more in expensive treatments and advanced devices where we think rationing through tough pricing mechanisms is going to be the highest. Of course the impact is just U.S.based. While its clear everyone is going to be affected we feel that our business which is mostly consumables and broadly based internationally is less likely to be problematic. Health Care remains a very strong franchise for 3M. Moving on local currency sales in Display and Graphics were up 18.4 another excellent quarter. Optical system sales were up 28 driven by new products for LED flatscreen televisions. In September we saw the beginning of the much talked about and highlyanticipated inventory adjustment in the LCD TV industry and we expect it to continue into the fourth quarter. This is clearly just the market adjustment as our film attachment rates remain as strong as ever. The inventory correction cost is about 15 million of earnings in the third quarter. Overall Im very pleased with the way our Optical business has matured and progressed. It wasnt that long ago that a hiccup in this business would cause us enormous heartburn. Yes today we still feel it and its always going to be a tough industry but genetically turns on a dime so to speak just as it did in September. We have a much better understanding of the market dynamics and how to manage them and we have absolutely superb management team in place to do it. Were building that what weve done in 3Ms traditional nonoptical core. Over the last five years also means that our optical business no longer has to hold the sales and earnings growth wagon more or less alone. Were so much more diverse in growth now than we once were. When Optical catches a cold yes it still means 3M taking a bit of nasty medicine but the company no longer gets about a figurative bubonic plague. Continuing with display commercial graphics continued the strong recovery with impressive doubledigit sales growth. Growth is coming from innovative new products right across and up and down the market spectrum. We also had positive growth in traffic safety systems quite an accomplishment really considering theres still no high refunding build in the United States. Total Display and Graphics operating income rose 37 to 282 million with margins of 26.4. Consumer and Office had a great Quarter 2 significantly outpacing growth at the retail level and they topped 1 billion in sales for the first time ever. Joe Holland and his team drove 11.1 local currency sales growth with a full nine points of organic growth. Yes nine points and another two points from acquisitions. Office products and the DIY business both achieved doubledigit local currency sales growth and Health Care and stationery products reached high singledigit growth too. As was the case last quarter we increased advertising and merchandising investment by over 30 year on year and that pushes advancing many of our key brands. Operating income for consumer office was 235 million with margins of 23. Safety Security and Protection Services sales were down 1.6 in local currency. Operating profit for SSPS was 164 million with margins of 20.2. This is truly a wonderful sector as in Health Care H1N1related demand did not repeat in the third quarter of 2010 in this case impacting yearonyear growth for SSPS by a whopping 10. The grocery products were also at margins strongly accretive to both the Security segment margins and to 3M as a whole. Consequently operating margins declined 700 basis points year on year which is entirely explained by H1N1 and secondarily by the impact of image protections in the Roofing Granules business both of which we consider to be temporary effects. Going forward Safety and Security margins in the fourth quarter will still be negatively affected by these same factors as well as by purchase accounting for Cogent and Attenti. These lapping impacts are purely an arithmetic issue with nothing fundamental to be concerned about. Margins will normalize around 23 as the H1N1 comps finish passing through the system sometime in the first half of next year. In the core of this business we saw a doubledigit sales increases in Security Systems Corrosion Protection Building and Commercial Services and also in Occupational Health and Environmental safety if we exclude the H1N1 effects I mentioned earlier. Electro and Communications. Sales in local currency were up 24 with currency translation adding another point and a half on top. I think its important to note the continued strength in our business servicing the consumer electronics industry. For example local currency sales were up 59 in electronic markets materials and 30 in Electronic Solutions division. In addition we saw a doubledigit local currency sales growth in electrical markets which mainly serves utilities and electrical distribution. Local currency sales were up slightly in the Telecom Infrastructure business also. Electro and Communications drove operating income of 173 million which is up 49 as operating margins expanded 3.6 percentage points up to 22.4. So all in all even with some transient H1N1 and raw material cost impacts this is another very strong performance across the board for 3M. Id like to peek now for a moment about acquisitions. We significantly strengthened our Safety and Security business by adding Attenti and Cogent to their portfolio. Cogent brings to 3M a technology platform that we didnt have previously with its finger palm and iris based biometric technologies and Attenti positions us well in the segment of law enforcement that we didnt have access to until now as well as opening opportunities for us in the eldercare and other industries. Both of these businesses are operating markets growing at greater than 20 annually. We see Attenti as a completely new highgrowth platform. Weve long believed that high value asset tracking is a great future business. The logical application extensions to military first responder eldercare mobile hospital assets mining safety animals and even in children if you decide it are massive. In Health Care the acquisition of Arizant bolsters our infection prevention business by solidifying our position in the growing area of patient safety with its line of patient and body fluid warming systems. This market is growing at doubledigit rates and is likely to accelerate since the focus on body core warming is specifically laid out in the new Health Care legislation and is seen as a fundamental method to the reduction of cost control of hospital flame infections. Today this is predominantly a U.S. business and we intend to leverage 3Ms worldclass international footprint to expand it overseas. Alpha Beta in our Industrial segment perfectly exemplifies our pyramid strategy in action by adding B and Ccare products to our own line of tape offerings. Alpha Beta is a worldclass ultra lowcost tape manufacturer located in the China region. Over the coming years we expect growth rate to be very high and well insource a lot of currently outsourced tape manufacturing to Alpha Beta. This is positioned right where the fastest growth is both geographically and segment wise. And importantly it establishes a lowcost tape manufacturing beachhead in Asia something we didnt have before. So this is a great business accretive addition to one of our most powerful core businesses. Its not an overstatement to say that 3M is the greatest Adhesives tape manufacturer in the world so investing here is perfectly logical for us. On RD you will note that for 3M investment in innovation is investment in our future. In the third quarter RD investments were north of 5 of sales and we expect to maintain this level going forward. As a result of these investments our New Product Vitality Index is now in the 32 range as we continue to drive innovation right across 3M. More than a year ago we forecasted economic growth will slow in the second half of 2010 in some of our markets. Some folks disagreed with us thinking that perhaps moving too conservative but I think things had played out largely the way that we anticipated and so the trend is no longer a surprise. Part of this is purely arithmetic yearoveryear comparisons but part is also clearly economic. Looking ahead the good news is that weve seen no signs of any broadscale broadbased double dip. If it does come we believe it would be limited in geography short in duration and relatively mild. Our overall growth remains good in those geographies where we expect it to be good and its hard where we expect it to be hard. No we have not seen China slowing and ironically if the RD does begin to appreciate it will provide you mostly net positive benefits. After all were highly profitable there and a net importer to China. Excluding Japan which itself had a 10.5 local currency growth in the quarter similar positive observations could be made for Asia broadly and for Latin America the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe. The practical reality is that those companies with broad footprints in emerging markets will prosper as long as they remain able to compete with small and fast growing local competitors. And for that you absolutely must be cost competitive. For the nearterm implications for the United States and Western Europe Germany in part are inspiring. We expect an extended period of slow recovery in these markets. The best news is that the recovery in automotive and a positive look in housing will look like enormous percentage changes. More broadly U.S. factory utilization remains low which implies a long recovery period in commercial construction. Industry transients in the industrial distribution channel have died down so theyre no longer healthy. Unemployment remains I think as we all know the key to the puzzle particularly in the United States. Nothing in the end markets suggest big changes in anything plus or minus except the numbers will look arithmetically slower. Invention and penetration remain the keys to grow fast in these slow markets and thats why the RD and business development investments that we spoke about earlier are essential. Breakthroughs in power distribution smart grid solar environmental and innovation more generally still provide big opportunities. Differentiation still works and 3M has that in its space. So gradual geographic realignment of our sales force may be needed to fully take advantage of opportunities in faster growing states and market spaces. With that Ill now turn the call over to Pat for a review of the third quarter PL.\\nPatrick Campbell Thanks George and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Sales rose 11 in the third quarter which was the fourth consecutive quarter of doubledigit sales improvement. Organic volume rose 10.8 in the quarter net growth was 1.4x worldwide industrial production as the business continues to expand in size in terms of sales operating income and economic profit. We drove 23 organic volumes in Asia Pacific with both consumer electronics and the base business increasing over 20. So our strategy around both exportoriented business and meeting local demand is working very well. Organic volumes grew 13 in Latin America 6 in the U.S. and 4 in Europe so no geography was left behind. Acquisitions added 50 basis points to growth from the quarter and selling prices declined just 20 basis points year on year. Third quarter gross profit dollars grew 9 year on year and notably were more than 5 above Q3 2008 levels. For our strategy to grow the business is resulting in higher gross profits. Gross margin percent declined 90 basis points with higher raw materials accounting for about one half of the change. Material inflation was approximately 2.5 year on year. Sales mix also negatively impacted gross margins in the quarter. As an example H1N1related respirator demand was strong in Q3 of last year and factory utilization levels in the businesses were very high. Those same factories ran at more normal levels this year. A lower sales contribution from Health Care coupled with these attractive gross margins also impacted the mix negatively. Helping to mitigate these factors were savings due to yield improvements waste reduction faster line speeds and ongoing productivity driven by our Six Sigma teams around the world. In the SGA area sales and marketing investments rose 18 in the quarter while administrative and other costs were up just slightly. So in total SGA was up 13. We anticipated this in our planning as we mobilize throughout the year to increase both sales coverage and marketing strength particularly in fastgrowing emerging economies. In addition we increased investment in advertising and merchandising by over 30 year on year to drive higher sales volume with our customers both now and into the future. We invested 354 million in research and development in the quarter up nearly 20 million over last years third quarter. Operating income was 1.6 billion the highest of any third quarter on our history and margins are now standing 22.9. All six reporting segments posted 20 plus margins the third consecutive quarter that we have accomplished this feat. Our corporate miscellaneous reporting segment showed a small loss this quarter versus the first six months run rate. This was largely due to lower corporate spending various compensationrelated adjustments and a few other miscellaneous items. By its nature profit loss in this segment can swing a bit from quarter to quarter. On a September yeartodate basis the operating loss in corporate miscellaneous is larger than 2009 by 117 million with the difference largely attributable to higher pension expense. The third quarter tax rate was 26.8 down about five points year on year due to more effective international rates and reflects some of the great progress we have made in reducing our tax rate. We expect that the full year reported tax rate will be approximately 28.5. Earnings were 1.53 per share on a GAAP reported basis an increase of 13. This also was a third quarter record for the company. Now lets look at the yeartodate results so please turn to Slide 7. We are very pleased with how the business has performed thus far in 2010 and are running ahead of our expectations going into the year. September yeartodate sales were up 17 nearly all driven by organic volume improvements. Asia and Latin America have been the stars in terms of geographic performance. On a businessbybusiness basis growth has been the strongest in the Electro and Communications at 31 Display and Graphics at 29 and Industrial and Transportation at 22. These three businesses have done an outstanding job at launching new products and taking share in a number of important and growing industries including Consumer Electronics Automotive OEM General and Industrial and Renewable Energy. Year to date SGA spending is up 11 investments in sales and marketing are up 14 a combination of more sales related fee demonstrate in growing markets further investments to strengthen our marketing capability and as you see on this chart a near 30 increase in advertising and promotion to drive current and longterm growth. Tight control over GA remains a top priority for the company as it help speed additional investment in sales and marketing and RD. On a yeartodate basis GA is up only 5 compared to sales growth of 17 so we continue to drive leverage in this area. Operating income is up 33 yeartodate and operating margins are over 23. All businesses are in 20 plus margins to the first nine months of the year. The reported tax rate through nine months was 28.3 down from 31.2 in 2009. Recall that our tax rate was 34 five years ago so were making us some progress in this area. We expect the rates to tick up a bit in 2011 which Ill talk more about in a moment but we remain committed to further longterm reductions in our rate. Evolving the manufacturing base to lower tax jurisdictions will be critical to making this happen. Finally yeartodate net income and earnings per share rose 40 and 36 respectively. Return On Invested Capital was a strong 22. Please turn to Slide 8 for a balance sheet and cash flow discussion. Free cash flow is 1.1 billion in the third quarter and we converted nearly 100 of net income to cash. This was 466 million less than the third quarter of 2009 driven largely by three factors One was pension contributions as we contributed 241 million more than we did last year. In addition the year on year difference in cash taxes paid was 111 million. Finally working capital changes reduced free cash flow by 175 million to meet the volume demands. On a yeartodate basis we generated nearly 3 billion of free cash flow and converted 94 of net income to cash. Networking capital turns remained steady yearoveryear at 5.1 turns. We had some improvement on the receivables side offset by somewhat higher inventories aligned of course again to the higher growth rates. Acquisition activity has been light in the first three quarters of the year. As we have recently announced and George has mentioned earlier well close a number of deals during the fourth quarter plainly use some of our excess cash. Through nine months of 2010 we returned more than 1.5 billion to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases a 43 increase versus 2009. With three quarters of the year behind us let me address our outlook for the year. Please turn to Slide 9. We now expect our organic volume growth will come in between 13.5 and 14 for the year versus the prior forecast of 13 to 15. We also expect that earnings per share will fall somewhere within the bend of 570 million to 574 million. This range includes estimated acquisition related dilution of approximately 0.06 per share related to the recently closed deals which are of course not factored into our July guidance. On a GAAP reported basis we expect earnings to finish for the year between 5.59 and 5.63 per share. We anticipate that operating margins will be approximately 22.5 for the year which also as I previously mentioned acquisitions. The fullyear tax rate is expected to be at or just below 28.5 on a reported basis and average diluted shares outstanding should be in the bend of 725 million to 727 million for 2010 in total. Please turn to Slide 10. As Matt mentioned well be hosting an investor meeting in the morning of December 7 in New York. Well address our detailed 2011 outlook at that meeting but I thought I give you a preview this morning. But please wait for the December meeting for some more specifics. At the moment we are targeting 2011 sales growth of 11 assuming a couple of points of acquisitions in current FX rates. We are driving the business to deliver 35 incremental margins on an organic growth. Outside of those incrementals currency should be an additional income tailwind for us again reflecting current exchange rates. We estimate that pension expense will be a 0.30 headwind next year. This assumes that the 4.86 discount rate at the end of the third quarter falls until year end which in our opinion is an unsustainably low level. But regardless it is down nearly a point from 5.77 that we used at last year end. The 2011 expense estimate also assumes U.S. asset returns of 11 which was our actual performance through the first nine months of the year Finally the 0.30 headwind assumes that we make an additional 700 million contribution to our pension plan assuming current discount rates and asset return performance will always hold. But candidly the actual contribution may differ. If rates or returns move our way which have happened thus far in October we would likely contribute much less than this. We dont have any mandatory funding obligations. What is most important for us is to be adequately funded at year end and to keep the earnings headwind at a manageable range. The anticipated expense increase is due to two factors One is the amortization of prior period investment returns namely the 13.6 loss experienced in 2008 and Ill remind you though this was far better than the 30 market decline for that year. The second factor is the absolute level of interest rates. More rates of course increase the present value of liabilities which in turn increase future pension expense. We also anticipate an 0.08 per share headwind due to our compensation policy change. As a reminder prior to 2009 we allowed employees to bank a certain amount of unused vacation. Effective January 1 2009 we moved to a user to loser approach and employees were given two years since the last time we have previously banked vacation. This change resulted in an 0.08 per share benefit in our 2010 results which does not repeat itself in 2011. This item is noncash income statement only. Helping to offset this will be additional productivity gains due to the fact that employees will have less time off in 2011 which will help rein in additional hiring. Finally at this early stage were expecting a 2011 tax rate of 30 or slightly below versus an estimated reported tax rate of 28.5 for 2010. We have some more work to do before reviewing our final 2011 plan with you in December but this should give you a sense of where we are headed. In summary I would conclude that our yeartodate results are very much in line with our longerterm strategy. Were driving faster growth reinvesting to secure the future of the business and maintaining bestinclass margins and return on capital. Our balance sheet remains in great shape so regardless of the shape of the economic recovery well have a significant funding advantage. That concludes the formal portion of todays conference call. So lets begin the QA.\\nOperator Operator Instructions And our first question comes from the line of Robert Cornell of Barclays.\\nRobert Cornell Despite having a good quarter but I think you mentioned an inflection point September maybe you could just go over that a little bit more and you talked the impact of the fourth quarter maybe just give us some visibility there please\\nGeorge Buckley Well obviously Bob you see every two years you see these kind of corrections that take place in inventory. The great news for us is we havent lost any attachment as far as we can tell which is unlike what happened to us before. So this is probably just started. I think itll go through the system the potential impact in the fourth quarter you see across in the end you dont know where this market changes so rapidly but the net impact we think might be as much as 70 million in our fourth quarter earnings. But...\\nRobert Cornell Thats on profit George\\nGeorge Buckley Thats on profit yes. So thats the sort of numeric number there Bob. But I think what has really happened so well here is weve got very close to these customers they like our innovation it captures in the product and that is for us the most important thing and well live through these things. And as I said weve had these things come and go before. This time of course you say it puts some pressure on earnings but its not the kind of outs that it once wouldve been.\\nRobert Cornell So you mentioned the Alpha Beta acquisition and you talked about putting some product back inhouse that have been outsourced and the whole push into the better adjacency I mean what sort of profitability level would Alpha Beta see relative to the 3M average when you have that strategy completed\\nGeorge Buckley Well at their current operating margins Bob they would be dilutive to 3M but when you bring them altogether I mean first of all we dont need to invest a lot of GA in that area since it not always branded product and we think its just this huge growth and leverage opportunities in that space Bob. I mean we were selling into that space and paying high prices than well get from Alpha Beta. So actually I think it will be helpful for us in the long run. And obviously this is not competitive positioning at the bottom of the marketplace which has always been the place where weve got attacked by growing sort of lowcost competition. So this is strategically very important for us not only to provide growth but to provide the kind of bulwark to our highermargin higherperforming tapes higher fee at the market premium. So its very important I think Bob.\\nPatrick Campbell Bob Ill just going to add just to kind of build on George comment. You have either the divisional level which is our largest division is Adhesives and Tapes. As George mentioned our objective there is well pull this in into some of the cost savings we have through in sourcing and the like that the margins in that business should hold where there truly out at the divisional level.\\nRobert Cornell So the margins at the division level would be the same when you consolidate Alpha Beta and push forward\\nPatrick Campbell Yes absolutely.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Morgan Stanley.\\nScott Davis Guys it wasnt 100 clear to me why you didnt have a little bit more of a margin pullthrough in Industrial and Transportation. I understand theres some raw material headwinds and such but given that type of growth rate in that type of business maybe we wouldve expected a little bit more incremental margin. Can you give us a little bit more detail on that\\nPatrick Campbell Yes. First of all Scott a 20 of margin in Industrial business is a damn good margin. Were obviously investing in that business. Were investing in new technology putting the new investment in a lot of the emerging markets and so forth. Reality is the margin in that business will be probably the 21 22 range over time. Its a little bit lower this quarter but nothing to be alarmed with. Its something that weve been kind of expecting through the time based on the investments that were making. So no alarm from our side at all as to where the margins in that business are.\\nScott Davis So the answer is basically investments that you  now would we think of that as investment some things that you put forward just given how strong every year you had discretionary spend and such that were pulled forward in the quarter\\nPatrick Campbell Yes. Itd be fair to say and I think if we go back a couple of calls that in my comments really for the year to date is that we are running ahead of where we thought we would be for the year. So we had a number of investments lined up that if conditions awarded effectively we would pull into 2010 here. So thats kind of just one example of an area that has occurred.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\\nJeffrey Sprague Can we  I guess Ill make my question and my followup around the deals. First when you look at largely what youve acquired here George I would say they have kind of the feel of being a bit more equipmentrelated companies with the exception of Alpha Beta rather than being kind of materials plansrelated company which is kind of the core strength and bailiwick of 3M. So just as a matter of kind of philosophically when you look at adjacencies for your businesses how you manage that the challenge that some of these are software companies in a sense and just the kind of the DNA for the organization to kind of do these types of deals going forward.\\nGeorge Buckley Weve long recognized that one of the big growth areas for the future is going to be kind of software and electronics. In fact if you look at our strapline Jeff over the last few years you see this kind of creeping in bit by bit. In fact maybe not creeping anymore its galloping. And so we recognize that this is going to be more the future a bigger piece of our portfolio in the future. If you look at some of these highgrowth spaces ultimately theyre about sort of tracking and decisionmaking ultimately is connected to electronics and software. So I think youre right in that area. These are very high growth areas and we have some sort of related businesses already Jeff. You might remember weve got library equipment business that tracks library books. This is kind of in a way a lateral extension of that kind of  instead of tracking a book youre tracking a person or tracking an eldercare person. So the not that different as you might think if you think of it in that context. But I think ultimately Jeff while we will always have this heartland of material signs I think we will see some movements into these kind of equipmentrelated businesses. But youre not going to see us getting into sort of a big giant machines like some of our contemporaries have. This is going to be kind of small carry with you type stuff on a much smaller scale in those sort of things but well spotted.\\nJeffrey Sprague And then I was just wondering as the followup if you can help us on the 11 you suggested for next year is kind of a base line given all these deals are kind of closing at different times. What kind of annualized deals impact is included in that 11\\nPatrick Campbell Yes. I guess all Im saying right now because we still have some more work to do between now and December is we have a couple of points of acquisitionrelated growth in that 11 number for next year. A piece of that is the deals investment now so theres a small provision for stuff that obviously is currently in the system.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford and Bernstein.\\nSteven Winoker Pat I know youre going to give all the detail in December on 2011 but on the guidance that you did provide here should we be adding that to adjusted or GAAP number as were trying to understand  think ahead to where would that 0.55 or 0.60 it looks like its implied on top of.\\nPatrick Campbell Steve Id come off of our GAAP numbers when we present our plan well come off of our GAAP numbers.\\nSteven Winoker And then without getting more into detail there for the quarter pricing was a 20 basis point headwind I think and at one point 440 basis points of that was in Asia Pacific. Am I correct in assuming that was mostly in Optical and Display and Graphics or were you seeing anymore pricing headwinds in any of your other businesses\\nPatrick Campbell It really remains in the Consumer Electronics space primarily optimal.\\nMatt Ginter Steve this is Matt. Just as a reminder generally speaking electronics in total for the company is about a one point impact on price in any given year. So really ex electronics pricing wouldve been up a little bit for the company.\\nSteven Winoker And then the raw material 2.5 was that concentrated in any particular segment\\nPatrick Campbell Well first of all its more of the U.S. than it is international at this point in time. Its probably more in our industrialrelated business at this point in time. But just cutting across most of the businesses but industrial probably has the large piece of it.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JP Morgan.\\nC. Stephen Tusa Just to be clear on I guess the fourth quarter numbers I think that the performance the organic performance this quarter was good it was about in line with kind of the comp wouldve suggested. But your comp gets a lot tougher in the fourth quarter and youre still really calling for here maybe just a couple of point degradation in the growth rate. Can you talk about which end markets are getting marketing better from a kind of comp perspective Thats going to help you out and I guess just where these new products are layering in the fourth quarter so where we would expect kind of the best organic performance here in the fourth quarter and then one quick follow up on 2011.\\nGeorge Buckley Well I think  obviously weve talked about some kind of correction in the Display and Graphics business Steve. And I think were still going to be carrying forward headwinds on H1N1 so theyll be the tougher comps. All of the businesses were growing very very rapidly last year and so its not going to be easy but the forecast from our businesses and our own triangulation suggests you looking at something like I think an 8 or so growth rate. Thats what the number looks like Steve thats what the arithmetic shows and so far the arithmetic has carried us forward. I think in the Health Care business I think its going to get a little bit easier. Its my guess I think weve got some stuff which looks like its better in that area. So I think that probably will get a little bit better. I dont expect the Industrial businesses to do all that much different. I think we might see just mild betterment in SSPS as H1 was  the back end of the fourth quarter was easing a little bit. So I think its a mixed bag Steve but all in all were comfortable with the projections that weve made.\\nPatrick Campbell And Steve and remember that if you back into the number thats 8 to 9 range which of course if you look at on a yearoveryear basis and you look at one of our performance was last year which youre doing which we had I think of 4 growth last year in the fourth quarter it is really an improvement in performance. But when you look at kind of where our longterm growth rate wants to be needs to be thats consistent with our plan. Electro and Communications continues to run very very strongly and theyll have a continued very strong fourth quarter here. Theres no reason in  Industrial continued at a doubledigit growth here in the fourth quarter. And surprisingly even Optical being down itll still be up on a yearoveryear basis. It just wont be as good as it has been in the previous couple of quarters. So all in all its a very solid performance across the board.\\nC. Stephen Tusa And then just one followup quickly on 2011...\\nMatt Ginter Im giving you guys the 2011 outlook now.\\nC. Stephen Tusa Theres a reason for everything I guess. The share count number got bumped up I think year to date youre looking at something in kind of the 724 725 range. Whats the fourth quarter ending share count in that number\\nGeorge Buckley So Steve you  must be talking about your model the exit rate is about 731.\\nC. Stephen Tusa So thats a headwind next year as well\\nGeorge Buckley Yes and what youll see kind of where through  well give you an assumption as what our share count will be next year when we meet. We just havent solidified that answer yet.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.\\nTerry Darling I wouldnt disappoint you here Pat with more 2011. We do appreciate all that. If we look at the balance sheet net debt to capital now negative can you George talk a little bit how youre thinking about the pace of acquisitions because youve got plenty of firepower here but presumably valuations are moving up and then maybe dovetailing off the share count perspective you clearly would have room to do some buyback as well and where is that in your thinking at this point\\nGeorge Buckley I think you can certainly start with your assumption Terry that were going to have an antidilution strategy. And weve been trying to figure out finally what our position is going to be on more share buybacks. But I think you are right. We probably will continue at a similar pace on acquisitions next year. Theres no reason to believe that it will be significantly off where we are today. Of course you cant define that exactly at this stage of the game. But I think there is one school of thought here that says we might have done some of our share buybacks next year a little bit above what weve done in the last couple of years. So its very much in the thinking Terry balanced approach. Well have a higher CapEx number next year perhaps 30 maybe even 40 higher than weve had this year. So you open that sort of 1 billion 3 billion 4 billion. Weve got a lot of demand in Asia a lot of demand in some of these new market spaces in Abrasives and Renewables Energy area. So were going to have sort of a balanced need I think but I do agree with you probably it will be some room for a little bit more share buyback next year than perhaps weve crucially done in the last few years.\\nTerry Darling Maybe Ill try to get away with the clarification with this one but on the 11 revenue growth in 11 couple of points in acquisition a point on FX organic implied around 8 is that fair\\nPatrick Campbell I will give you more okay. But youre releasing the rates stage here...\\nTerry Darling 35 incrementals next year flow through. We do obviously across the industrial spectrum see rising raw material prices. Presumably that means youve got to accelerate some of your own price increase activity there. Just talk about your confidence on managing a tougher raw material environment in 2011 around sustaining that 35 flowthrough at this segment profit level.\\nGeorge Buckley Well first of all Terry its something we have to do. And of course our first focus will be on driving productivity or gaining class reduction programs. But to the degree that we do need to take out pricing we will do that. Follow to earlier comment on raw materials I think the steep head was  it is a little more pocketed. So certain industries will probably have to take some price here. Realistically you probably lag a little bit to data to surprise increases that we probably maybe shouldve done a little bit sooner. So we are currently contemplating some additional pricing.\\nGeorge Buckley Some of this is actually happening right now Terry so were on it and I think youre right. I think were also seeing some easing in some key commodities not huge easing and not making that prediction but so a little bit of easing bolstered by some price that captured close.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citigroup.\\nDeane Dray So it sounds as though the 2011 framework puts you at or above that longerterm 7 to 8 organic revenue growth goal. So I was hoping George can you comment on some of these recent moves that move you along that target And just with regard to Alpha Beta how that is this the pyramid new product introductions of now the Index and now 34 of revenues from emerging markets. All of this moves you towards this goal should we expect more of the same or is there further initiative\\nGeorge Buckley No I think we like the pathway were going down Deanae and you correctly interpreted pretty much all of what were doing driving the top line innovation thats why mentioned that 32 MPBI number. Thats important. That will keep on filling the sort of the top of the hopper. Our improvement strategy of which Alpha Beta is part of helps us bulwark some of the leakage that might come. So thats an important part of the puzzle. Youre right about our emphasis on emerging markets completely correct and also youll see some of the acquisitions Deane Attenti Cogent in much higher growth spaces than traditionally have been the case with 3M. So were playing all the sort of the strings on the fiddle and so far the music is coming out okay. Im sure here and there things wont turn out exactly as we hope but I think the last piece of the puzzle Deane not the necessarily and on any kind of negative note is weve got to start trying to put more of the magic on I think on our U.S. business on our Western European businesses but with the kind of capabilities that we have I mean when you think comparing us left right versus many of our competitors you wonder how ultimately we are not going to win that battle. So I think its now just a question of emphasizing those a little bit more and that might give us yet some more lift in due course. So I think youve already  youve outlined the plan and the data right on. I dont think its going to change a great deal Deane.\\nDeane Dray And just a followup the comment on Cogent I mean youre already in a passport security system. What else does Cogent add in terms of a security platform\\nGeorge Buckley Well theyre primarily border crossing bordersecurity type applications so theyre all highsecurity military embassies those sort of things where you need highsecurity entry. So theyre in the classic fingerprint areas and remembering that the only thing that a criminal leaves at a crime site is a fingerprint its still very important to local law enforcements so thats still important. But you get up in the level of sophistication iris scanning palm scanning those sort of things are kind of part and parcel of the secular move toward much more secured border crossing environment with smarter passports smarter should we say biometric interrogation of people passing the border so I think this is just a steady move up the technology space for us and into higher growth spaces Deane.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\\nDavid Begleiter George this is now your fourth quarter in a row of above market growth. Do you think youre gaining credit for that in the market And if not what will it take to get credit for this above market growth code that youve perhaps cracked here\\nGeorge Buckley Well I think Dave obviously we want the same thing that you do. I think understandably investors want to see a track record. Theyre Im sure very pleased with how its gone so far but I think ultimately Ive kind of viewed another couple of quarters maybe well get to the tipping point of peoples opinion but its still a lot of work to be done before them. Weve got to continue to work at this. Host the stuff that we know we know how to do the innovation we know how to do the customer engagement and so maybe were not getting quite the full credit for it yet but I think its no time to be impatient. At least not for us we keep on doing what we do well and I have every confidence that itll come our way in due course David. But thank you for the implied help there.\\nDavid Begleiter And Pat just in 2011 why the higher tax rate and will acquisitions be dilutive to 2011 EPS\\nPatrick Campbell First of all acquisitions will be  when you look at it on a yearoveryear basis the changing guidance that weve had in 2010 here acquisitions will actually be a little bit accretive for us on getting a yearoveryear basis slightly. Tax rate at this point in time our planning standpoint our structural rate is more around 30 right now. So thats what well probably put in our plan for next year. Our longterm goal is 28.5 and keep driving that down. We are able to pull some things off this year that were more kind of one time in nature and obviously the tax seems still has an assignment for next year to keep finding those things but its probably prudent at this point in time to probably plan around a 30 rate.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Buckingham Research.\\nJohn Roberts Do you think the correction in the display marketplace will flush through in the quarter or do you think it could be something that can linger into early 2011\\nGeorge Buckley Well you never really know. Depends on how sellthrough goes in the Christmas season is the answer to that question. But Ill try to address it. I think the vast majority of any image correction must be true. This is an industry with about six weeks inventory in the channel and their ability to flush you through is very rapid. So you kind of see these things that short and sharp. They drop fast they come back fast. If history has anything to teach us I think that youll see the first quarter once the correction has gone through youll see the first quarter accompanied by some more rapid growth or return to rapid growth. But also traditionally its usually associated with this is some extra pricing pressure as the OEMs try to use that as means of just short of bulldozing their way through. They just basically  they dont like volumes dropping and one of the games they play one of the tools they use to push through. So I think thats the sort of environment that youll see. And so I think that will ease as the first quarter goes through maybe the second quarter. So thats kind of the pattern short sharp fully fixed in the fourth quarter depending on sell through probably surface and some pricing pressure in the first half of the year and higher volumes. Thats probably the way this thing is going to pan out.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies  Company.\\nLucy Watson Good morning this is Lucy Watson on for Lawrence today. Just wanted to ask it sounds like about 40 to 50 basis points is the gross margin contraction this quarter was due to unfavorable mix. And Im wondering if we should be taking in something around that range of unfavorable mix going forward indiscernible.\\nGeorge Buckley Yes Lucy it depends on what period of time youre thinking off is a piece of that is raw materials. We think were going through kind of the peak of that right now. That actually should kind of structure declined and we think a little bit. Another piece of this of course is the mix of the business that we have between Health Care and Safety kind of being down. The H1N1 piece will obviously will last us for another quarter. So that impact will still be there. But we do expect Health Care will perform better in the fourth quarter than they did in the third quarter. So maybe on a little bit  but I dont think the same degree of reduction Lucy.\\nOperator Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal from FBR Capital Markets.\\nAjay Kejriwal Just wanted to follow up on your comment on DG and pricing in the first half next year. So some pressure there but then would be interested in your thoughts on volume and the trends youre seeing with LED penetration and then expectations for large LCD TVs growth rates going into next year\\nGeorge Buckley Well I think youll probably see some mix shifts as when theres any sense of market pressure these manufacturers try fishing in different ponds to see where they can catch a big crunch of customers. So thats where I think the pricing mix will sort of pan out. Well see and probably experiments in lower brightness experiments maybe without films experiments with fewer LEDs and a few things like that. But I think ultimately I mean in the past those things are not worthwhile to be completely honest with you and the customers being unwilling really on a consistent basis accept those. So I suspect that once the flushing has gone through the channel it will return to more normalized basis. But I think its  theres been a fairly sizable gap between the standard CCFL TVs and the LED TVs. I suspect that gap that will compress. And so theyll use that obviously to drive I think volume at the top of the performance pyramid. So a lot of kind of I suspect turbulence even in the fourth quarter but certainly going over into the first quarter until they find a new mix of sales brightness sizes that seems to suit current market conditions. So some turbulence probably putting pressures on price but volume coming back would be my prediction.\\nPatrick Campbell Yes. We still expect flat panel TVs will still be a strong double digit. LED I think was youre kind of  youve got a specific question on LED the industry probably will run 20 25 this year. That number should be about to 2x probably in 2011 if were probably approaching 50. So obviously thats a favorable mix shift for us.\\nAjay Kejriwal And just on that 30 increase in adding merchandising spend clearly investing to push growth here. Maybe insight into how these expenses crack over the next few quarters and then the expectation on the payback\\nPatrick Campbell Lets say it kind of continues investments so its not necessarily lumpy once we have as a good and the base will keep going. Its a little bit  it adds up somewhat seasonal related especially in the Consumer business. But our tracking is  we have a very good tracking mechanism as to what we invest versus are we getting the sales back and its driven by business but its a longterm  its investment for us both in the developed part of the world if you at all are a TV watcher youve seen far more TV ads as well as online ads here in the U.S. But importantly were also investing a fair amount in the emerging markets. Now is the time to be investing in our brands in emerging markets and in some cases that will not pay back immediately. Some of this is a longerterm payback and some of those emerging markets.\\nOperator And our next question is a followup question from the line of Stephen Tusa from JP Morgan.\\nC. Stephen Tusa Just on the first half for next year you talked about Display and Graphics getting better I think the fourth quarter. Is there anything going on with the comps that are going to make kind of growth uneven as you look out to next year for the DG or any other businesses\\nGeorge Buckley Stephen we havent completely quarterized next year okay But nothing that comes necessarily to my mind. You look at  there still was a little bit of H1N1 rollover into the first half of this year. So Safety has a little bit probably a tougher comp early in the year versus late in the year. Other than that I dont see I think that is kind of materially different on a quarterbyquarter basis.\\nPatrick Campbell Steve I think H1N1 was in the neighborhood of 40 million to 50 million in the first quarter of 2010.\\nOperator That concludes the questionandanswer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for closing comments.\\nGeorge Buckley Thanks everybody for attending and we look forward to seeing you on December 7.\\nPatrick Campbell Thanks everybody.\\nOperator Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

Adkerson Good morning everyone. As well be talking about as I do review these highlights its been a very active quarter for us here at FCX. Results from our global mining operations have been solid our teams continue to execute our plans in a very effective way. In Indonesia we had an important milestone in progressing our efforts to reach stabilization of our business there in terms of our negotiations with the government with the signing of definitive divestment agreements on September 27. Operations current operations in Papua have been strong and weve made important progress in transitioning the Grasberg ore body mining from open pit to underground so well talk about that. We are continuing our sharp focus on the important things about our business to build shareholder value. Our unit net costs are at 0.93 a pound significantly below last year and in line with our plans it does reflect for the nine months 0.02 as a result of the successful settlement of our labor situation in Cerro Verde and Peru so that was very good. Operating cash flows exceeded CapEx in the third quarter by 740 million ph 2.5 billion todate. Net debt as Kathleen mentioned is down 2 billion from the start of the year. And this agreement with Inalum is really important. It establishes the path to reaching longterm stability and derisk our operations over the longterm in Indonesia. Were going to talk about Lone Star. I mean were very excited about it in terms of the future of our company and this is a ore body thats been identified for decades but were doing a lot of core drilling and the more we drill the more optimistic we get about this ore body becoming a worldclass mining operation in the future. Its growing now has the potential to grow in the future. Slide 4 ph copper market its a paradox. To be frank with you its a paradox right now. Physical markets are tight. Fundamental drivers remain very positive and yet sentiment about the commodity and about companies like ours in the investor marketplace is what it is and you know their concerns about global growth in China and so forth. But when you look at the fundamentals and look at this drop in global copper exchange stocks and to see the copper price in that slide parallel to each other is very unusual in our industry typically when inventory stocks drop and theyre also dropping at our customers that indicates higher copper prices but thats not what we experienced since June. But when you look at the fundamentals U.S. constructions and manufacturing remained positive Europe is steady and positive large Chinese fabricators are running at higher rates. Our customers have strong order books for us in the United States and business in China is good. Cathode availability is tight globally. Theres issues with smelters disruptions in Chile and elsewhere in India. China is constraining scrap. Global stocks are down 40 since the copper price was well over 3 almost 3.30 in early June and this is a multiyear low stocks. But speculators are bearish on sentiment and macro drivers and this is having a significant impact on price. The longterm fundamentals are becoming increasingly strong. Deficits are inevitable absent a significant downturn in China and the global economy and a lot of positives are happening in terms of alternative energy generations electric vehicles and so forth for our project. Now whats this doing to us This uncertainty is causing us certainly to slow down our longterm plans to develop our resources. I mean were going to defer those investment decisions until there is clarity in the marketplace. Were continuing to work on them do preparation for them. Were optimistic about them but this situation is causing us to defer and I believe it will cause other companies to defer and that will add to this impending supply gap situation for the industry. So as I said its a paradox. I was in London for LME Week and most industry executives I talked to there and on the business roundtable believe that this trade situation will get resolved in a way that doesnt disrupt the global economy. But investors are skeptical and thats what we have to deal with in terms of the current situation. A slide that we commonly show or have shown for many years is on page 5 and it makes an important information here. Its very difficult to replicate a worldclass resource. The industry is supply constrained discoveries are rare. There is 7 to 10year lead times to develop new projects. And when you go down this list of the days major copper mines in terms of reserves and production you see Escondida and Grasberg in the 1980s Las Bambas in 2000s and then other mines are 100 years old or more. And with all the activity thats gone on since the super cycle started in 2003 there havent been new additions to these charts. We think Lone Star is going to be on this chart at some point but its important for our industry to note this issue of supply challenges. And that points to the strength of our company with our strong current production levels and our future resources. So operations update on page 6. As I talk about were focused on productivity and cost management. Weve had some success with that. Theres some cost inflation but weve largely been able to offset that through efficiency moves and you can see that in our numbers. Our production and cost outlook is stabilizing as we see going forward. In 2016 2017 because of the low copper prices and some degree because of the situation of our company we cut back costs. We constrained maintenance capital. We were focused on costs principally. Now were looking to  and you see this in our numbers in 2018 in Americas were looking to maintain our production volumes going forward. We cut mining rates and now were increasing mining rates and that involves some costs inherently. But now as we look far with our plans we think our costs are stabilized. And we do think were going to be able to manage cost inflation in an effective way so thats an important part of what were doing in operation. Well talk more about Lone Star but beyond that were evaluating our project pipeline to consider alternatives rank them make decisions about what we might do in the future. Were going to remain disciplined and we have the chance the opportunities to do low risk capital expansions when the market is right for doing that. So in Indonesia you can see we had really strong performance in the third quarter and yeartodate in 2018. After an extended period of time of issues associated with our workforce some of our operating systems and with security issues we are now operating in a very effective way safe operation strong production making progress on the things that we need to address. Were mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit in the fourth quarter of this year. I was there when we were drilling the core holes in 1988 and its amazing to think about here we are finishing the pit. Were going to extend operations in the pit into 2019 by mining. Our guys came out with a great idea. We had some haul truck ramps that have some high grade ore in it and so we were originally just going to abandon those and mine that ore from the underground. Now were going to go back in in the first half of the year and access some of those high grade sections of the haul roads and mine that. By mid2019 well be complete in the pit and itll be significantly winding down now and going forward. At the Deep MLZ mine which is an important mine for our future its separate from the Grasberg Block Cave mine which really has the bulk of our reserves over the remaining terms of our operating rights to 2041. This Deep MLZ is a great mine. Its a separate mineralization area that started with the Ertsberg pit years ago and we began block caving that mineralization area in the early 1980s actually. And as we commenced this in 20162017 we started experiencing for the first time in our operation these mininginduced seismic events. To address that we are using a procedure of using hydraulic fracturing of the rock to manage seismicity and precondition the cave. This is done in South America and Chile. Its not complicated technology. Its established and weve begun that process and today its been effective in doing what we wanted to do. So its giving us increased confidence derisk our plans for the mid2019 startup of caving in the Deep MLZ. With the Grasberg Block Cave after years of investment plans our infrastructure is now in place. Were successfully testing a new underground rail system and ore flow system. Were conducting initial blast for undercutting during the third quarter. Rock testing confirms that this rock is suitable. Its the same ore that weve been mining since 1990 in the Grasberg open pit and its suitable for a really effective block cave mining. And our company is the worlds leader in underground mining because of all the experience we have. In terms of scale this is going to be the largest underground operation ever done. But in terms of the technical challenges is things weve worked with for years and were very comfortable in doing it. So Lone Star those of you who follow us know that this Lone Star resource is located in Eastern Arizona adjacent to our Safford mine which began operations  was beginning operations 11 years ago when we acquired Phelps Dodge and now the Safford oxide ore is declining production. And so we have excess processing facilities that we are going to use in mining oxide ore from Lone Star. Were stripping this. You can see the pictures of the progress weve made by stripping it. Year end 2017 reserves were 4.4 billion pounds of copper only oxides. Its 850 million project. Were well into it and its got 200 million pounds annually of production for 20 years. Now as we drill this ore body the oxide resources are expanding and this has given us some opportunities. And then we had previously drilled an underlying what appears to be very large sulfide resource. And our current drilling is confirming this and extending the sulfide resource. So what were doing now with the oxide project is in essence stripping this material to expose what could be a worldclass sulfide resource. Morenci is just over the mountains very nearby. This has the potential of being a Morencitype ore body in the future. And its going to be a key part of FCXs future going forward. So returning back to PTFI and Indonesia heres where we stand. As Kathleen said there are no significant changes today to our previous outlook. Activities during this quarter have in our view derisked to a significant degree our ability to achieve this. But we will have  as we complete any mining activities from the pit in mid2019 well have two transition years in terms of achieving production rates for the Deep MLZ and ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave. And when I say ramping up you see the rust red part of the slide showing the Block Cave ramping up. The purple slots above that showing the Deep MLZ mine ramping up and thats supplemented by the existing DOZ mine which is above the Deep MLZ mine which is in its decline phase. So we will have a very significant copper and gold this year. Well have a couple of years. And you can see all the numbers here shown for you below this chart. And then well be reaching the levels that we will have for our longterm mine operations when all this is fully developed and operating as planned. And that extends through 2041 and this will be one of the worlds largest copper mines big gold mine very attractive economics because of mixture of both longterm low cost operations. So the agreement with Inalum the agreement with Inalum that we signed on September 27 in my view is very important and its very positive outcome for all parties. And when I say all parties that includes the government its stateowned company Inalum achieving objectives that they had clearly communicated to us over the years. Our joint venture partner Rio Tinto is achieving  will be achieving its objective of exiting this asset. They were facing divestment in any event. They have negotiated a valuation thats acceptable both to them and to the government. And then to our shareholders I will tell you this Im much more pleased about where we are today than what I expected to be last year when we signed the framework agreement. And the reason for that was  the key to this being so positive for all the partners actually was Rio Tintos decision to sell. The government is acquiring Rio Tintos interest which will ultimately be a 40 interest. Were only having to divest an effective just over 5 interest in the property. A year ago we thought we might have to invest 27. So that avoided a very difficult valuation negotiation and so forth. At the end of the day PTFI the Indonesian subsidiary will get bigger. Previously it was a joint venture partner with Rio Tinto and now Rio Tintos interest will come into PTFI. PTFI will then have the total operations. The shareholder own  and it will continue as an entity. The shareholder ownership interest will be 51 Inalum 49 FCX. We have agreed on a shareholder arrangement that protects the economics that FCX had under the Rio Tinto joint venture agreement. So we will be getting substantially all of the production through 2022. Weve agreed on a corporate governance operating structure where we will be partners with Inalum in terms of the corporate structure but there will be a shareholders agreement that will grant FCX control over an operating committee to ensure that operations are run in a consistent way with what weve done now and consistent with the longterm mine plan that weve agreed to. We will have extension of rights through 2041 with assured fiscal and legal terms and legal enforceability. And there are no significant changes in those terms from our contract work. So all of this comes together that gives us a very positive deal. Now one thing that I believe is very important is by having Inalum as a 51 partner and they seem to be on the verge of commencing the activities of raising the bond financing to finance this acquisition from Rio Tinto is that well now have an alignment of interest between the government and the Indonesian Freeport. They will want to see the operations run with stability because theyll need cash flows to fund this significant debt theyre taking on. And the markets being very positive  appears to be very positive in terms of being receptive to this bond offering and so theyll want to see the operation run smoothly to generate cash flows to service their debt and generate dividends. So I believe firmly that this will create a better overall environment for operations than what weve experienced in recent years because of the divergence of opinions and views about what we should be doing now. I think were all going to be together aligned and that will be helpful. So we have a very diversified global set of assets. Were in a leadership position. The core feature of our company is we operate all the assets that we own interest in. That gives us significant operational synergy shared resources. We can allocate capital in a way thats prudent and effective. Large longterm production capacity with longterm expansion. Threequarters of our reserves and resources are located in North America and South America. In todays world thats a positive. Weve got a great team experienced in operations project development execution innovation leadership in the industry. And in the United States we benefit from the improved regulatory environment but also across the tax situation. One consequence of the oil and gas deal was a very large tax loss carryforward which means were not going to pay taxes in the United States for many years. And the recent Tax Reform Act actually drops the effective tax rate for our company absent the NOL to around 10. Thats a big difference from what you face internationally. So thats going to be very positive for us in terms of looking at Indonesia. Now market valuations  market valuation  Ive been around long enough to know thats just what it is. But the one thing the way weve looked at this recently to think about talks about the valuation of our asset is recognizing going back to that chart of the major mines where we have three of todays major mines that the portfolio that FCX have is very difficult to replicate. Our copper equivalent capacity to our equity share is about 4.5 billion pounds of copper a year. When we look through projects around the world that were looking at and others are looking at we see its 8 to 10 a pound to develop capacity. And that means on that simple highlevel metric that the implied replacement cost for our current capacity is on the order of plus or minus 40 billion. Just a thought for you guys to look at but thats where we are. Okay so 2018 outlook is unchanged from previous guidance copper at 3.8 billion pounds golds a bit higher at 2.45 million sic ounces molybdenum 95 million pounds site production costs reflecting this 0.02 special item at Cerro Verde for the labor settlements in line with where were before after byproduct credits just over 1 operating cash flows at 2.85 for copper for the fourth quarter it would be sic 4.2 billion.
